On Git commit message

- A good commit message should answer about the what and the why's instead of the how.
- Before starting a project or introducing a new member to the team, there should be an agreed conventions on commit messages.

CSS

- To edit the size of an image without distorting its proportion, set the `height` to auto and adjust `width` accordingly.

- The BOX MODEL
    - Everything in your page, is a box, whether rectangular or square, you should always think of them as a box that has three properties
        - Padding: the space between the content and border
        - Border: The space between the margin and padding
        - Margin: The space of this box between other adjacent boxes
    - Note that height and width sets the size of the content not padding, border or margins
        - to circumvent this, use boxsizing: border-box; to make the height account for padding and border, margin is exclude
        - actually the box-sizing: border-box; is frequently used to make css adjustments so much easier, because elements would be more predictable
            - thats why its almost always included in global definitions
    - By default margins do not add/ they collapse between two elements so imagine that one box has a margin-bottom of 40px and the next box has margin-top of 40px the margin
        - whichever is the largest margin thats the one that would be used.


- Block and Inline elements
    - Two types of display 
        - outer
            - inline
            - block
        - inner
            - flex
            - inline-block
            - inline-flex


- Flexbox
    Using flexbox we could create complicated website layouts with ease, we can manipulate the direction and alignments of items with relative ease compared to using floats.
    - flex container
    - flex items

    on Flex items
        - We define flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis

    - align-items, justify-content 
        - these are interchanged when orientation(flex-direction) of the flex container is changed (row or column)

    - flex-direction
       - row or column
        - note that flex-basis changes based on what you've defined here, row flex-basis pertains to width, while column flex-basis is height
